     Determine if two optional dates are equal in a specific calendar unit based on the current calendar.

     The comparison is made from largest to smallest calendar unit.
     Only when the specified calendar unit and above are all the same, it is considered the same.
     Therefore, there is no scenario of passing multiple granularities.

     eg: 2000-01-01 and 2000-05-01 are not equal in `.day`, including the granularities of hours, minutes, and seconds.

     - Parameters:
       - granularity: The dimension to be compared.

     - Returns: Returns `true` if both are `nil`.
